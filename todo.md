General:

- add graphs to shown changes in evolvable params over time for both birds and bees, both each param in their own plot
- add behaviour for when max birds or bees has been reached, to prevent endless nest circling and useless nectar collection
- slightly vary the max lifetimes to prevent all birds or bees from falling out of the sky at once.
