General:

- make sure the nests and hives are rendered on top of the tree they're on but behind any overlapping trees or shrubs, make sure the hive progressbars are rendered on top of everyting when toggled on.
- add varying stylized designs for the birds that are heritable. randomly choose which parent is the male or female and use that to deicide which characteristic it passes on. so some characterisitcs should be male inherited while otheres are female inherited
- automatically reset if all birds or all bees die.

Future improvements:

- implement lifetimes for both the birds and bees.
- add nectar and bee consumption as a prerequisit for prolonged survival, a bee or bird should consume nectar or a bee every x second or else it dies.

- add evolutionary dynamics by slightly varying the boid parameters and having them pass on during reproduction with some mutation rate. for the birds use the parameters from the parents and for the bees have the hive produce bees that are the average of the bees that brought the nectar to produce it.
- add graphs (violin plots) to the toggleable menu to show the distribution of the evlovable parameters in both the birds and bees.
- add graphs to the toggleable menu.
